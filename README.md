Here's an abstract-style README for building an end-to-end speech recognition pipeline. This README outlines the high-level structure, components, and purpose of the project.

üó£Ô∏è End-to-End Speech Recognition Pipeline
Overview
This project implements a complete end-to-end speech recognition pipeline, transforming raw audio input into human-readable text. It leverages modern deep learning techniques for feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language decoding, aiming to deliver an accurate and efficient Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.

Features
üîâ Audio Preprocessing: Noise reduction, silence trimming, resampling, and normalization.

üìà Feature Extraction: MFCCs, Mel spectrograms, or log-Mel filterbanks using librosa or torchaudio.

üß† Acoustic Modeling: Deep learning-based models such as CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, or Conformer architectures.

üßæ Decoder & Language Model Integration: Greedy decoding, beam search, or CTC/WFST-based decoding with optional language model integration.

üìä Evaluation: Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and other performance metrics.

üì¶ Modularity: Each component is modular, making it easy to swap models or preprocessors.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow (optional), librosa, torchaudio, transformers, jiwer

Datasets: CommonVoice, LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM, or custom audio datasets
